		<h2>Meaning of the Chart:</h2>
		The animation above shows how board members of Japanese electric companies give “personal donations” to LDP. They formed organizational pattern at least from 2007 to 2011.
		<br class="none" />
		A color of animated bar represents his position of the board. And the nine different background colors mean nine different electric power companies which operate exclusively in each district of Japan.
		<br class="none" />
		<br class="none" />
		See, many bars in the same color move synchronously and reach similar amount of donation. it implys the board members’ donations were not actually personal. They probably set amount of donation by positions. And the money would represent the intentions of the companies.
		<br class="none" />
		And see 2011, the year of Fukushima disaster, Almost all officers suddenly stopped their donations.
		<h2>Context:</h2>
		Japanese electric power companies have been publicly proclaiming that they refrain from donating to political parties since 1974, because of publicness of the operation.
		<br class="none" />
		But instead of the names of companies, the board members’ personal donations to the Liberal Democratic Party had been existing at least from 2007 to 2010.
		<br class="none" />
		Although the ruling party  was The Democratic Party of Japan when Fukushima disaster happened, the Liberal Democratic Party was dominating Japanese administration over 50 years since 1955.
		<br class="none" />
		So LDP is responsible for almost entire history of adopting, constructing, and regulating the nuclear power plants from the beginning. And in 2012, LDP came back to the administration led by Abe. He is now pursuing restart of Japanese nuclear plants, and export of nuclear plants.
		<br class="none" />
		<br class="none" />
		The causation and aftermath of Fukushima nuclear disaster were probably affected by such politics-electric industry corruption.
		<br class="none" />
		There are a number of scandals. For example, TEPCO didn’t report cracks of nuclear reactors until it was revealed in 2002, or repeated leakage of tanks containing radioactive waters, or Yakuza-relationship for broking laborers, and so on. But such conditions haven't been improved. The range of scandals don’t limit TEPCO, Many scandals of other companies were revealed from time to time as well.
